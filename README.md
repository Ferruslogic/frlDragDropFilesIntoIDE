### Stacks

In addition to the multimedia files, we will also have the possibility of dragging any binary or code-only stack to our IDE to open it.

### Replace one multimedia with another.

To update the content of a multimedia object in our IDE. We press the Alt + Shift keys on Windows and Option + shift on Mac OS. Then we drag and drop the file onto the object. So if we have an image in our stack we press the keys according to our operating system and we drop the file of the new image without releasing the keys and the content of the image will be replaced.
